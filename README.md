EasyShipper
===========

WooCommerce integration for EasyPost, now with Customs Forms

EasyPost is a simple shipping API for your app or site. 

With over a Million Downloads, Woocommerce is the #1 Shopping Cart for Wordpress.

This plugin allows you to use EasyPost within WooCommerce, and ship anywhere in the world.

### Roadmap

This plugin adds a box on every product page for you to enter the HS Tariff Code, and uses it to create your Customs form.
- Would like to make a "default" box in plugin admin that allows seller with only one category of product to set and forget setting

Right now, plugin is hard-coded to retrieve only First Class and Priority rates from USPS for both domestic and int'l shipments.
- Would like to setup preferred shipping methods in plugin admin

Plugin retrieval of rates is not always reliable. Sometimes rates for both priority and firstclass show up, sometimes only one.
